OpenUnOJ
========

Open source fork of the currently closed development UnOJ. A distributed judger online judge system that is built to be secure and robust.

OpenUnOJ is built to be compatible with its original system and provides instructions for deployment. OpenUnOJ builds some functions together to simplify things at the cost of modularity of certain features (E.g. you cannot separate the daemon and webserver nor run an independant file-server, there is no support for Judge Clusters unless you somehow get the source code of that or roll your own that works with the spec).
